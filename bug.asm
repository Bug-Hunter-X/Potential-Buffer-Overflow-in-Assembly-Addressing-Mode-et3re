```assembly
mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4]
```
This code snippet has a potential bug related to addressing mode.  If `ecx` is a large value, it could lead to accessing memory outside the allocated space of the program, resulting in a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  This is particularly dangerous if `ecx` is controlled by user input.
