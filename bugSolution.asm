```assembly
;Check the bounds of ecx before accessing memory
mov edx, [some_limit_address] ;Load the memory limit
cmp ecx, edx
jge handle_overflow ;Jump if ecx exceeds the limit
mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4]
jmp after_access
handle_overflow:
;Handle the overflow condition appropriately (e.g., return an error)
mov eax, -1 ;Return an error code
after_access:
;Continue with the program
```
This solution incorporates bounds checking before accessing memory.  It compares `ecx` with a pre-defined limit loaded into `edx`.  If `ecx` exceeds the limit, it jumps to an error-handling routine; otherwise, it proceeds with the memory access.  This prevents out-of-bounds memory access and improves the code's robustness.
